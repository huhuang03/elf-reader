* sh_addr
Virtual address of the section in memory, for sections that are loaded.

* sh_offset
Offset of the section in the file image.

* sh_size
Size in bytes of the section in the file image. May be 0.

* sh_entsize
Contains the size, in bytes, of each entry, for sections that contain fixed-size entries. Otherwise, this field contains zero.

I think this define the section data contains fixed-size entries, and this is the size off each entry
